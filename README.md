<b>Features from 'Roboto + Weather':</b>
- Location-based weather notifications
- Notifications update every 15 minutes
- Alerts you if connection is lost with phone (icon + vibration)

<b>What's changed:</b>
- Font is changed from 'Roboto' to 'Futura' to give a cleaner and more uniform interface
- Weather notifications are divided from time and date with a white background (à la 'Weather Watch' by Katharine)
- Month removed from date
- Alert vibration pattern slightly modified

<b>Version 1.72 (June 18, 2013)</b>
- 3-character temperature support (above 100° and below -10°)

<b>Version 1.71 (June 17, 2013)</b>
- Moved weather script to another location, provided by Luke Korth

<b>Version 1.7 (June 1, 2013)</b>
- Initial '0' removed from day of month
- Internet connection issues not considered as phone connection loss, i.e. no vibration alert (fix by ZoneMR)
