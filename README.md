**Features from 'Roboto + Weather':
- Location-based weather notifications
- Notifications update every 15 minutes
- Alerts you if connection is lost with phone (icon + vibration)

What's changed:
- Font is changed from 'Roboto' to 'Futura' to give a cleaner and more uniform interface
- Weather notifications are divided from time and date with a white background (Ã  la 'Weather Watch' by Katharine)
- Month removed from date
- Alert vibration pattern slightly modified

For the weather notifications to work you need to have the 'httpebble' app installed on your phone. 

Android users:
- Download and install 'httpebble' from Google Play:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble

iOS users:
- Open http://macbuildserver.com/try/ on your phone
- Paste the following link in the "GitHub repo" field: https://github.com/Katharine/httpebble-ios
- Click 'Next' until the build is done
- Install the app on your iPhone and run it
- The app connects to your Pebble and is able to send weather notifications to this watchface
